  ;; '(helm-mode-handle-completion-in-region nil)

  ;; NEW FAULTS
  ;; - When reloading .spacemacs, the highlight-search colour changes to
  ;;   yellow.
  ;; - whitespace-mode is no longer disabled in diff-mode

  ;; Things to fix
  ;; - Helm completion on file/directory names should never pick one if there
  ;;   are multiple matches when you press tab
  ;; - Something wrong with "A" in some circumstances
  ;; - Closing a window seems to move the focus in unpredictable ways.
  ;; - Sometimes when you type ":" the focus changes to a different window
  ;; - Slowness
  ;; - Page up held down doesn't scroll properly
  ;; - Page up doesn't move the cursor to the top line if there isn't a
  ;;   screenful above  (Page up/down issues apparently fixed in dev spacemacs)
  ;; - OCaml mode: tab does nothing at all
  ;; - C mode: sometimes movement wraps around from one line to the next.
  ;;   Also the indentation is a bit weird.  In C for example, type
  ;;   void (foo)
  ;;   {
  ;;   }
  ;;   and the braces will be all over the place
  ;; - Window movement commands (^W ...) don't work in customize buffers
  ;;   (and in some magit buffers IIRC)
  ;; - If you select with V and then indent with > then the selection doesn't
  ;;   clear.  Partially fixed above but the point ends up in the wrong place
  ;;   sometimes...
  ;; - Still problems with starting multiple instances on occasion. e.g. Warning
  ;;   (initialization): An error occurred while loading
  ;;   /home/mshinwell/.emacs.d/init.el: Symbol's value as variable is void:
  ;;   defun )
  ;; - "emacs foo" does not open "foo" seemingly without a keypress, which then
  ;;   also causes an error
  ;; - ":q" does not exit seemingly without a keypress
  ;; - Silence "no later matching history item" (needs match on the text)
  ;; - In tuareg mode, if you open a quote for a string, the cursor is not
  ;;   prevented from moving from the end of one line to the start of the
  ;;   next (upon pressing right-arrow), like it normally is
  ;; - Flickering upon scrolling
  ;; - Up/down arrows don't work after / (for search history)
  ;; - e.g. "4>" doesn't work; the 4 is ignored.
  ;; - When moving up to a previous ":sp" command, the cursor doesn't move to
  ;;   the end of the command suitable for easy editing
  ;; - Ctrl+G doesn't do the right thing.  This is a pain because sometimes
  ;;   the line/char positions aren't visible on the RHS of the status line
  ;;   (e.g. when window vertically split)
  ;; - Undo seems to be coalescing actions
  ;; - Something reverted window-combination-resize to t.
  ;; - Moving CR comments using < in tuareg mode screws up the indentation
  ;; - If you have a second frame in another tty then Ctrl+Z doesn't work to
  ;;   suspend the first one any more.  It says "There are other tty frames
  ;;   open; close them before suspending Emacs".
  ;; - Ediff bindings! The window motion keys don't work
  ;; - "Failed to apply window resizing" when trying to close a window

;; New list of annoyances
;; Tab behaviour in OCaml mode.  Below "<spc><spc><spc><spc>|<spc>id<spc>->"
;; it indents under the "d"...
;; Company mode switching itself on after it's been disabled
;; Company mode completing not only on "."
;; When I search for something, the highlighting seems to be case insensitive,
;; even though the search itself is case sensitive.
;; "ZZ" is inconsistent.  Sometimes it quits when there are buffers remaining.
;; Make Tab in tuareg mode just go to the first non-space column from the
;; previous line, or if that is zero, indent by 8
)

;; Do not write anything past this comment. This is where Emacs will
;; auto-generate custom variable definitions.
